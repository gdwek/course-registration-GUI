# course-registration-GUI
A graphical user interphase for a course registration system.
This is a university course registration system using object-oriented programming. It has two types of users: an admin and students. They each have a variety of options within the program, such as registering for courses or viewing course information. Upon terminating, the data is serialized.

The structure of the project is as follows: There are interfaces for both admin and student, and admin and student inherit from a class named user. For testing purposes, the username for the admin is Admin and the password is Admin001.
